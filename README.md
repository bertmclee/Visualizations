# Data Visualization Portfolio

Welcome to my Data Visualization Portfolio! This repository serves as a showcase of my work in data visualization, featuring projects from different datasets and themes. Each project within this repository utilizes a variety of tools and techniques to extract and present meaningful insights through visual representation.

## Current Visualizations

### NBA Divisional Matchups

The project visualizes the NBA regular season matchups, focusing on games played between teams across different divisions. It highlights the structure of the NBA's divisions and conferences, emphasizing the frequency of intra- and inter-division games.

#### Visualization Description

- **File Name**: `NBA_Divisional_Matchups.png`
- **Techniques Used**: The visualization was crafted using R and ggplot2, employing advanced statistical methods to organize teams by division and conference. The `facet_grid` function was used to create separation between divisions, making the structure of the data more apparent.
